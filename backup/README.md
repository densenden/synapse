# Synapse – AI-Powered Relationship Optimization App

## 🚀 Introduction
Synapse is an AI-powered application that enhances relationships through real-time insights, reminders, and emotional intelligence. The app discreetly analyzes conversations, schedules, and shared priorities to help partners stay aligned, avoid misunderstandings, and show appreciation at the right moments.

Unlike a surveillance tool, Synapse operates on a **consent-based system**, allowing both partners to customize their level of shared data. The goal is to foster deeper connections and strengthen relationships through smart, AI-driven assistance.

## 🔥 Features
- **Real-Time Emotional Insights:** Understand your partner's mood and key concerns throughout the day.
- **Context-Aware Reminders:** Receive gentle nudges to acknowledge important topics, anniversaries, and shared priorities.
- **Smart Notifications:** Get timely alerts to avoid misunderstandings or respond thoughtfully in sensitive situations.
- **Customizable Privacy Controls:** Each user can adjust their data-sharing preferences, ensuring full transparency and control.
- **AI-Driven Relationship Support:** Benefit from personalized suggestions to improve communication and emotional connection.
