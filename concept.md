# Synapse – The AI Relationship Assistant

## 🧠 Vision
Synapse is an AI-powered companion designed to help people improve their relationships through awareness, context, and emotional intelligence. Built with privacy and ethics at its core, Synapse aims to be the most personal, trusted, and supportive assistant in your daily life – for the moments that really matter.

## 💡 What It Does
Synapse analyzes your day to help you show up as your best self in your relationship. By understanding mood, context, and communication patterns, it offers:

- Gentle reminders to check in with your partner
- Suggestions based on shared plans, emotional states, or small but important details
- Early warnings for emotional misalignment or potential conflict
- Personalized encouragement to show care, support, or empathy at the right time

All with the goal of enhancing connection, avoiding misunderstandings, and deepening emotional bonds.

## 🔐 Privacy & Ethics: Local AI, Zero Surveillance
We believe in **privacy by design**. Synapse does not send or store your private conversations, messages, or files on external servers. Instead, we use **on-device AI processing**, following the same standards introduced by:

- **Apple Intelligence** (iOS 18)
- **Samsung Galaxy AI**

This means:
- All analysis happens locally, on your phone.
- No third-party access to your data.
- You decide what content Synapse can use.
- No surveillance, no recording, no spying.

Synapse functions more like a **Copilot for your relationship** than a data-hungry assistant. It's there when you need it – and invisible when you don't.

## 🤖 Technology
- **On-device LLM / AI modules** for sentiment and context detection
- **Natural Language Understanding** for text and voice inputs
- **Secure APIs** for calendar, reminders, and task sync (user-authorized only)
- **End-to-end encrypted local storage** for temporary data caching

## 👥 Use Cases
- You come home and are reminded that your partner had a big day – you ask how it went.
- You get a subtle nudge: "Don't forget to acknowledge that thing they mentioned this morning."
- You sense emotional tension. Synapse detects it too, and encourages softening your tone.
- You're planning your week. Synapse helps you align shared time and priorities.

## 🔄 Flow & Consent
Synapse only works when both partners **opt-in**. Each user can control:
- What sources Synapse can access (e.g. calendar, selected chats)
- When it should notify or remain silent
- How suggestions are phrased (gentle, direct, etc.)

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Couples who want to grow closer and reduce friction
- People in long-distance relationships
- Busy professionals looking for emotional clarity
- Therapy or coaching clients as a complementary tool

## 💸 Business Model
- Freemium with Pro tiers (mood timeline, AI coaching, shared space)
- Couples subscription: $8.99/month per user
- Privacy-first, no ads, no reselling of data – ever.

**Let's build a future where tech helps us feel more connected – not more distracted.**
